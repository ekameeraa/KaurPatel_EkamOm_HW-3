## KaurPatel_EkamOm_HW-3

This project shows how powerful it is to use AJAX and Vue.js to create dynamic web applications. We develop a variety of frontend interactions for a website that is undergoing a brand refresh by using an API to retrieve data from a database. Our software presents a list of tracks and lets users see extensive details about each song and album.

## Installation
